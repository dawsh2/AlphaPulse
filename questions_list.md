# AlphaPulse Pilot - Clarification Questions

## Questions to Address for Implementation Clarity

### ❓ **Question 1: Jupyter Integration Architecture**
**Status**: ✅ Answered
**Answer**: Option A - Separate services (Flask on 5002, Jupyter on 8888)
**Details**:
- Flask handles: Data APIs, real-time WebSocket data, chart serving, CORS
- Jupyter handles: Notebook execution only
- Monaco editor bridge is straightforward: cell content → HTTP → Jupyter kernel → results
- Single-user mode initially, but build with multi-user in mind
- Persistent notebooks via .ipynb format (user choice), otherwise session-based

**Context**: Clean separation allows Flask to handle what it does well (APIs, real-time data) while Jupyter focuses on execution.

### ❓ **Question 2: Data Loading Strategy**
**Status**: ✅ Answered
**Answer**: Option B - Query DuckDB directly from Jupyter notebooks
**Details**:
- User-owned databases (`market_data_user123.duckdb`) to avoid conflicts
- Shared `DataAccessor` class to prevent duplicated data logic
- No artificial notebook limits - users manage their own concurrency
- Direct file access for performance (~10x faster for large datasets)

**Context**: Performance benefits outweigh complexity when users have isolated data access.

### ❓ **Question 3: Strategy Configuration Format**
**Status**: ✅ Answered
**Answer**: NautilusTrader native format (Python files) initially
**Details**:
- Strategies as Python files following NautilusTrader conventions
- Tight coupling with NautilusTrader initially to learn the patterns
- Future: Standardized config language that generates appropriate files for different backends (Nautilus, LEAN, etc.)
- Abstraction layer will emerge after extensive NautilusTrader experience

**Context**: Start pragmatic, abstract later once patterns are understood.

### ❓ **Question 4: Alternative Data Priority**
**Status**: ✅ Answered
**Answer**: Option A - Start with free data sources (not mock)
**Details**:
- Use real free APIs for news, sentiment data
- Examples: Reddit API, free news feeds, public sentiment sources
- Real data flow, real integration patterns, no fake responses
- Upgrade to paid APIs later once workflows are proven

**Context**: Proof of concept with real free data validates the approach without upfront costs.

### ❓ **Question 5: Execution Engine Data Source**
**Status**: ✅ Answered
**Answer**: Option A - Our DuckDB/Parquet storage as master source
**Details**:
- DuckDB/Parquet is our personal master, detached from backends
- NautilusTrader uses ParquetDataCatalog (same format!)
- Conversion: DuckDB → DataFrame → NT Wranglers → NT ParquetDataCatalog
- Live trading uses NT's API adapters directly
- Low friction: Both use Parquet, just need data wranglers

**Context**: NT already uses Parquet, making conversion straightforward.

### ❓ **Question 6: Performance Reality Check**
**Status**: ✅ Answered
**Answer**: Multi-year, multi-symbol datasets (1M+ rows) eventually
**Details**:
- No real-time streaming in Jupyter (no advantage)
- Will handle multi-year datasets (Option B) eventually
- Remove arbitrary "<10 seconds" performance target
- Let performance requirements emerge from actual usage

**Context**: Focus on functionality first, optimize when bottlenecks appear.

---

### ❓ **Question 7: Development Approach**
**Status**: ✅ Answered
**Answer**: Option A - Get basic Jupyter execution working first
**Details**:
- Need Jupyter environment to test analytics code
- Option C (parallel) is valid but A is logical sequence
- Can't effectively develop analytics without execution environment
- Once Jupyter works, can iterate quickly on analytics library

**Context**: Execution environment is prerequisite for analytics development.

---

### ❓ **Question 8: Existing Code Integration**
**Status**: ✅ Answered
**Answer**: No need for separate `alphapulse_analytics` library
**Details**:
- Expand existing `data_service.py` and `analysis_service.py`
- These already provide the core functionality needed
- Make them importable from Jupyter notebooks directly
- Add new methods as needed for notebook workflows

**Context**: Reuse existing working code instead of duplicating.

---

### ❓ **Question 9: User Interface Strategy**
**Status**: ✅ Answered
**Answer**: Option A - Frontend notebook interface (Monaco editor)
**Details**:
- Frontend is much nicer than working directly with Jupyter
- Easy access to snippet library
- Better integrated user experience
- Jupyter runs headless as execution backend only

**Context**: Frontend provides superior UX while Jupyter handles execution.

---

### ❓ **Question 10: Dependency Management**
**Status**: ✅ Answered
**Answer**: Simplified dependencies, no TA-lib
**Details**:
- Skip TA-lib entirely (C compilation hassles)
- Use backend services for indicators
- pandas-ta as fallback if needed (pure Python)
- Add QuantStats for portfolio analytics
- NautilusTrader installed separately when needed

**Context**: Keep dependencies simple, use existing backend capabilities.
