# Foundation Architecture - Mission Statement

## Mission
Establish the fundamental architecture and integration patterns for the AlphaPulse DeFi arbitrage system, ensuring seamless integration with existing infrastructure while maintaining professional standards and operational excellence.

## Core Objectives
1. **Define System Boundaries**: Clear scope and integration points
2. **Establish Architecture Patterns**: Professional, modular, testable design
3. **Plan Integration Strategy**: Leverage existing AlphaPulse infrastructure
4. **Create Deployment Framework**: Testnet to production migration strategy

## Deliverables
- [ ] System overview with integration points
- [ ] Component architecture with clean interfaces  
- [ ] Data flow diagrams and message protocols
- [ ] Deployment strategy and operational procedures

## Organizational Note
**Important**: If implementation requires deviating from planned scope to address foundational issues, we must:
1. **Document the deviation** in this directory
2. **Create new subdirectories** for tangential work (e.g., `01-foundation/protocol-extensions/`, `01-foundation/relay-enhancements/`)
3. **Update task checklists** to reflect actual work completed
4. **Maintain org-mode style hierarchical task structure**

This ensures complete traceability of actual vs planned work and prevents scope creep without documentation.

## Directory Structure Guidelines
```
01-foundation/
├── README.md                    # This mission statement
├── TASKS.md                     # Master task checklist
├── system-overview.md           # ✓ Core system architecture
├── component-architecture.md    # Detailed component design
├── data-flow.md                # Message flow and protocols
├── deployment-strategy.md       # Migration and ops strategy
│
└── [dynamic-subdirs]/          # Created as needed for tangential work
    ├── protocol-extensions/     # If message protocol needs changes
    ├── relay-enhancements/     # If relay server needs modifications
    ├── database-schema/        # If new tables are required
    └── [other-as-needed]/      # Recursive structure as required
```

Each subdirectory created must include its own README.md with mission statement and TASKS.md with specific checklists.
