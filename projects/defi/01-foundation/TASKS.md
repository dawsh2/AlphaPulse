# Foundation Architecture Tasks

## Status: IN PROGRESS
**Owner**: Implementation Agent  
**Started**: TBD  
**Target Completion**: Week 1

## Phase 1: System Architecture Definition

### 1.1 System Overview Documentation
- [x] Create system overview with AlphaPulse integration points
- [ ] Define system boundaries (in-scope vs out-of-scope)
- [ ] Document performance requirements and SLAs
- [ ] Establish security requirements and compliance needs
- [ ] Review and validate with stakeholders

### 1.2 Component Architecture Design
- [ ] Define core component interfaces and traits
- [ ] Design modular strategy pattern for arbitrage types
- [ ] Specify execution engine abstractions
- [ ] Document risk management component architecture
- [ ] Create dependency injection and testing framework

### 1.3 Data Flow and Integration
- [ ] Map current AlphaPulse message flow
- [ ] Design DeFi message protocol extensions
- [ ] Define relay server integration points
- [ ] Specify database schema extensions
- [ ] Document API interfaces between components

### 1.4 Deployment Strategy
- [ ] Design testnet validation procedures
- [ ] Create production deployment pipeline
- [ ] Define monitoring and alerting requirements
- [ ] Establish backup and disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Document operational runbooks

## Phase 2: Technical Deep Dives (If Required)

### 2.1 Message Protocol Extensions [CONDITIONAL]
**Trigger**: If binary protocol needs significant changes
- [ ] Create `protocol-extensions/` subdirectory
- [ ] Document protocol version compatibility strategy
- [ ] Design backwards compatibility mechanisms
- [ ] Test protocol performance implications

### 2.2 Relay Server Enhancements [CONDITIONAL]  
**Trigger**: If relay server needs DeFi-specific modifications
- [ ] Create `relay-enhancements/` subdirectory
- [ ] Design DeFi message routing logic
- [ ] Implement opportunity filtering mechanisms
- [ ] Test performance impact on existing functionality

### 2.3 Database Schema Evolution [CONDITIONAL]
**Trigger**: If significant database changes are required
- [ ] Create `database-schema/` subdirectory  
- [ ] Design migration scripts for schema changes
- [ ] Plan data retention and archival strategies
- [ ] Test performance implications of new tables

## Phase 3: Validation and Review

### 3.1 Architecture Review
- [ ] Conduct internal technical review
- [ ] Validate integration assumptions with existing codebase
- [ ] Performance modeling and capacity planning
- [ ] Security architecture review

### 3.2 Stakeholder Alignment
- [ ] Present architecture to development team
- [ ] Validate operational requirements with ops team
- [ ] Confirm security requirements with security team
- [ ] Get formal approval to proceed to implementation

## Completion Criteria

### Must-Have Deliverables
- [ ] Complete system overview with integration diagrams
- [ ] Detailed component architecture with interfaces
- [ ] Data flow documentation with message specifications
- [ ] Deployment strategy with operational procedures
- [ ] All stakeholder reviews completed and approved

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Architecture review completed with no major concerns
- [ ] Integration points validated with existing codebase
- [ ] Performance requirements clearly defined and achievable
- [ ] Security requirements documented and addressable
- [ ] Team consensus on technical approach
