# Mempool Monitoring - Implementation Tasks

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup ⚡
*Timeline: Days 1-3*

### WebSocket Infrastructure
- [ ] Create `MempoolMonitor` service in Rust
  - [ ] Implement Ankr WebSocket connection with auto-reconnect
  - [ ] Add subscription management for multiple event types
  - [ ] Create message parsing and routing system
  - [ ] Implement connection health monitoring

### Transaction Classification

  - [ ] Identify DEX router calls (Uniswap V2/V3, QuickSwap)
  - [ ] Decode swap parameters (token in/out, amounts)
  - [ ] Classify liquidity events (add/remove)
  - [ ] Detect token transfers and approvals

### Data Storage
- [ ] Design mempool database schema
  ```sql
  pending_transactions (hash, from, to, value, gas_price, input, timestamp)
  decoded_swaps (tx_hash, dex, token_in, token_out, amount_in, amount_out)
  liquidity_events (tx_hash, pool, type, token0_amount, token1_amount)
  ```
- [ ] Implement data retention policy (24-hour sliding window)
- [ ] Create indexes for real-time queries

### Monitoring Dashboard
- [ ] Add mempool stats to existing dashboard
  - [ ] Transaction rate gauge (target: 50+ tx/sec)
  - [ ] Pending swap feed with decoded parameters
  - [ ] Gas price heatmap
  - [ ] MEV opportunity alerts

## Phase 2: Predictive Analytics 🧠
*Timeline: Days 4-7*

### Price Impact Models
- [ ] Implement swap impact calculator
  - [ ] Use pool reserves to calculate price movement
  - [ ] Account for multi-hop swaps
  - [ ] Factor in gas costs for execution

### Sandwich Attack Detection
- [ ] Build sandwich opportunity detector
  ```rust
  struct SandwichOpportunity {
      target_tx: Transaction,
      expected_profit: f64,
      front_run_gas: u64,
      back_run_gas: u64,
  }
  ```
- [ ] Calculate optimal sandwich parameters
- [ ] Implement profit/loss simulator

### Liquidity Flow Analysis
- [ ] Track pending liquidity changes
  - [ ] Monitor add/remove liquidity transactions
  - [ ] Predict pool depth changes
  - [ ] Alert on significant liquidity events

### MEV Scoring System
- [ ] Create opportunity ranking algorithm
  - [ ] Score based on profit potential
  - [ ] Factor in execution probability
  - [ ] Consider gas competition
  - [ ] Account for slippage risks

## Phase 3: System Integration 🔧
*Timeline: Days 8-10*

### Arbitrage Engine Integration
- [ ] Connect mempool monitor to execution engine
  - [ ] Add predictive signals to opportunity detection
  - [ ] Implement pre-positioning for anticipated moves
  - [ ] Create protective execution modes

### Dashboard Enhancement
- [ ] Upgrade arbitrage dashboard with mempool data
  ```typescript
  interface MempoolEnhancedOpportunity {
    standard: ArbitrageOpportunity;
    mempool: {
      pendingSwaps: PendingSwap[];
      sandwichRisk: number;
      predictedImpact: number;
      mevScore: number;
    };
  }
  ```
- [ ] Add predictive indicators to opportunity cards
- [ ] Show mempool-based warnings (sandwich risk, front-run probability)

### Alert System
- [ ] Implement real-time notifications
  - [ ] High-value pending swaps (>$10,000)
  - [ ] Sandwich opportunities (>$100 profit)
  - [ ] Liquidation transactions
  - [ ] Unusual gas price spikes

### Risk Management
- [ ] Add mempool-aware protections
  - [ ] Detect if our transaction might be sandwiched
  - [ ] Adjust gas prices based on mempool competition
  - [ ] Cancel transactions if unfavorable mempool conditions

## Phase 4: Advanced Strategies 🚀
*Timeline: Days 11-14*

### Multi-Block MEV
- [ ] Implement cross-block strategies
  - [ ] Track transaction ordering across blocks
  - [ ] Identify multi-block arbitrage paths
  - [ ] Optimize for block producer patterns

### Liquidation Monitoring
- [ ] Build DeFi position tracker
  - [ ] Monitor lending protocol positions
  - [ ] Calculate liquidation thresholds
  - [ ] Predict liquidations from price movements

### Statistical Arbitrage
- [ ] Develop order flow analysis
  - [ ] Build buy/sell pressure indicators
  - [ ] Create short-term price predictors
  - [ ] Implement mean reversion strategies

### Gas Optimization
