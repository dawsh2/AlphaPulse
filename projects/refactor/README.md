# Refactor - Architecture Improvement Plans

## Purpose
This directory contains architectural refactoring documentation and planning documents for improving the AlphaPulse codebase structure, maintainability, and scalability.

## Files

### `strategies.md`
**Strategy-Based Architecture Refactor**
- Proposes separating the monolithic `OpportunityDetector` into distinct strategy modules
- Defines strategy pattern for different arbitrage approaches (V2, V3, Flash, Cross-chain)
- Outlines clean separation between scanning, execution, and infrastructure concerns
- Includes migration strategy and implementation roadmap

## Adding New Refactor Plans

Before adding new refactoring documents:

1. **Check for duplication**: Ensure the proposed refactor doesn't overlap with existing plans in:
   - `projects/system-cleanup/` - System-wide cleanup and organization
   - `projects/defi/` - DeFi-specific improvements  
   - `projects/registry/` - Data registry and protocol improvements

2. **Document purpose**: Clearly state what architectural problem you're solving

3. **Include migration path**: Always provide a phased approach that maintains system functionality

4. **Update this README**: Add your new document to the file list above

## Refactoring Principles

From CLAUDE.md and STYLE.md:

- **One Canonical Source**: No duplicated implementations with adjective prefixes
- **Respect Project Structure**: Maintain service boundaries 
- **Quality Over Speed**: Build robust, validated solutions
- **Production-Ready**: Every change must be production-quality from start
- **README-First Development**: Document before implementing
