# Foundation Setup - Mission Statement

## Mission
Establish robust safety measures, dependency management, and governance structures that will ensure zero data loss and minimal risk during the AlphaPulse backend reorganization.

## Core Objectives
1. **Prerequisite Migration**: Complete Symbol → Instrument terminology migration
2. **Safety Infrastructure**: Create institutional deprecation areas with clear governance
3. **Dependency Management**: Implement workspace-level configuration for Rust and Python
4. **Rollback Procedures**: Establish and test comprehensive rollback capabilities
5. **CI/CD Preparation**: Update pipelines to support new structure without breaking existing flows

## Strategic Value
- **Risk Mitigation**: Copy-first strategy prevents accidental data loss
- **Dependency Control**: Centralized version management reduces conflicts
- **Team Confidence**: Clear rollback procedures enable bold changes
- **Audit Trail**: Complete migration history for compliance and learning

## Critical Prerequisites
⚠️ **Symbol → Instrument Migration**: This MUST be completed before ANY file reorganization begins. This migration affects:
- 878+ instances across 102 files
- Core protocol definitions
- Database schemas
- Service interfaces
- API endpoints

## Foundation Components

### Institutional Deprecation Area
A governed system for safely parking files during migration:
- Dated folders for tracking file lifecycle
- 90-day review cycle for permanent deletion
- Team approval required for final removal
- Git-tracked for complete recovery capability

### Workspace Configuration
Centralized dependency management:
- **Rust**: Workspace-level Cargo.toml with shared dependencies
- **Python**: Poetry for robust package management
- **TypeScript**: Workspace configuration for frontend

### Migration Tracking
Comprehensive documentation of all changes:
- MIGRATION.md as source of truth
- Automated logging of file movements
- Performance metrics before/after
- Decision documentation

## Deliverables
- [ ] Symbol → Instrument migration completed and validated
- [ ] Deprecation area created with governance documentation
- [ ] Workspace dependencies configured and tested
- [ ] Rollback procedures documented and practiced
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines updated for new structure
- [ ] Communication channels established

## Organizational Note
**Important**: Foundation setup may spawn unexpected complexity:
1. **Dependency Conflicts**: May need to resolve version incompatibilities
2. **CI/CD Complexity**: Pipeline updates might require DevOps coordination
3. **Testing Gaps**: May discover missing test coverage during validation
4. **Documentation Debt**: May need to update significant documentation

Expected subdirectories for complex work:
```
01-foundation/
├── symbol-migration-validation/  # Testing migration completeness
├── dependency-resolution/        # Solving version conflicts
├── ci-cd-updates/               # Pipeline modifications
├── rollback-testing/            # Practice runs
└── communication-templates/     # Stakeholder updates
```

## Success Criteria
- **Migration Complete**: All 878+ symbol references updated
- **Tests Passing**: 100% of existing tests pass post-migration
- **Dependencies Clean**: No version conflicts or duplicates
- **Rollback Tested**: Successfully rolled back and restored in dev
- **Team Aligned**: All stakeholders informed and prepared

## Risk Mitigation
- **Data Loss**: Copy-first strategy, never delete without backup
- **Service Disruption**: Test each change in development first
- **Import Breakage**: Automated tools for import updates
- **Team Confusion**: Clear communication and documentation

## Timeline
- **Day 1-2**: Symbol → Instrument migration
- **Day 3**: Deprecation area and governance setup
- **Day 4**: Workspace dependency configuration
- **Day 5**: CI/CD updates and testing
- **Day 6-7**: Rollback testing and documentation

## Next Steps
1. Begin with Symbol → Instrument migration
2. Create deprecation area structure
3. Configure workspace dependencies
4. Test rollback procedures
5. Update CI/CD pipelines
