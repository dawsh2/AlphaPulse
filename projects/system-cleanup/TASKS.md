# System Cleanup - Master Task Checklist

## Phase 0: Message Protocol Migration ‚ö†Ô∏è PREREQUISITE
*Timeline: Week 0 - MUST COMPLETE BEFORE ANY OTHER PHASES*

### Pre-Migration Validation
- [ ] Review `projects/registry/MESSAGE_PROTOCOL.md` for full specification

## Notes and Reminders

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Message protocol migration MUST be completed before ANY file reorganization

üîê **SAFETY**: Replace all unsafe transmutes with zerocopy for memory safety

üÜî **BIJECTIVE**: Ensure all InstrumentIds are reversible for debugging

‚úÖ **CHECKSUMS**: Validate CRC32 checksums at every message hop

üìù **IMPORTANT**: Update MIGRATION.md after each significant change

üîÑ **REMEMBER**: Always use copy-first strategy, validate, then remove

üìä **TRACK**: Performance metrics before and after each phase (<35Œºs target)

üéØ **FOCUS**: One phase at a time, with full validation between phases
