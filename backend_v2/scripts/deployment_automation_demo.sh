echo ""
echo "2. Health Check Integration:"
echo 'use alphapulse_health_check::{HealthCheckServer, ServiceHealth};'
echo 'let health = ServiceHealth::new("my_service");'
echo 'let server = HealthCheckServer::new(health, 8001);'
echo 'server.start().await?;'
echo ""
echo "3. Environment-Specific Configuration:"
echo 'ALPHAPULSE_ENV=production ./my_service  # Uses production.toml'
echo 'ALPHAPULSE_ENV=staging ./my_service     # Uses staging.toml'
