# Mycelium Messenger

**A truly decentralized, high-performance encrypted messenger built on the AlphaPulse Protocol V2 TLV architecture.**

## Overview

Mycelium Messenger leverages the ultra-high throughput capabilities of AlphaPulse's Protocol V2 (50M msg/s) to create a peer-to-peer encrypted messaging platform that outperforms centralized alternatives while maintaining true decentralization and censorship resistance.

## Core Architecture

### Message Protocol
Built on proven AlphaPulse TLV system with fixed-size message categories:
- **Short Messages (128 bytes)**: 56 bytes usable content
- **Medium Messages (512 bytes)**: 440 bytes usable content  
- **Long Messages (2048 bytes)**: 1976 bytes usable content
- **File Chunks (4096 bytes)**: 3988 bytes usable content per chunk

### User Identity System
Uses AlphaPulse's bijective identifier system for deterministic, collision-free user IDs:

```rust
// Deterministic user ID generation
let user_id = UserId::from_username_domain("alice", "example.com");
// Anyone can compute Alice's ID, but only Alice has the private key
```

**Key Properties**:
- **Deterministic**: Same username@domain always produces same ID
- **Collision-Free**: Cryptographically impossible to generate duplicate IDs
- **No Phone Numbers**: Privacy-focused username-based system
- **Self-Describing**: IDs embed domain and user information

### Encryption Architecture

**Hybrid Key System**:
- **Identity Keys**: Long-term Ed25519 keypairs derived from user credentials
- **Session Keys**: Ephemeral ChaCha20Poly1305 keys for forward secrecy
- **Key Exchange**: ECDH for establishing shared secrets

**Security Features**:
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Only sender and recipient can decrypt messages
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Compromised long-term keys don't affect past conversations
- **Replay Protection**: Sequence numbers prevent message replay attacks
- **Zero-Knowledge Routing**: Relay nodes route without reading content

## Decentralization Model

### Node Types
- **User Nodes**: Background daemons running on user devices
- **Relay Nodes**: Voluntary forwarding nodes for offline message storage
- **Directory Nodes**: DHT for user discovery (public keys and connection info)

### Network Topology
Uses AlphaPulse's topology system for:
- **Automatic Transport Selection**: Unix sockets, TCP, UDP based on node proximity
- **Mesh Networking**: Self-healing network with multiple paths
- **Load Balancing**: Automatic distribution across available relay nodes

### Message Routing
```rust
// Messages route via bijective IDs without central servers
#[repr(C, packed)]
struct EncryptedMessage {
    sender_id: UserId,        // Source routing info
    recipient_id: UserId,     // Destination routing info  
    timestamp_ns: u64,        // Replay protection
    sequence: u64,            // Message ordering
    encrypted_payload: [u8],  // ChaCha20Poly1305 encrypted content
}
```

## Key Exchange Protocol

### Initial Connection Flow
1. **User Discovery**: Query DHT for recipient's public key and connection info
2. **Key Exchange Request**: Send Ed25519 public key + ephemeral ECDH key
3. **Shared Secret**: Both parties derive ChaCha20 session key via ECDH
4. **Session Establishment**: Begin encrypted communication with forward secrecy

### Trust Model
- **No Certificate Authorities**: Direct public key verification
- **Web of Trust**: Users verify each other's keys through side channels
- **Key Fingerprints**: Visual verification for high-security contacts

## Performance Characteristics

### Throughput
- **50M messages/second** theoretical maximum
- **Sub-microsecond processing** per message with zero-copy TLV operations
- **Unlimited concurrent conversations** (limited only by network bandwidth)

### Latency
- **<35Î¼s hot path processing** (measured AlphaPulse performance)
- **Sub-second message delivery** for online recipients
- **Zero-copy operations** eliminate serialization overhead

### Scalability
- **Millions of concurrent users** supported by swarm architecture
- **Automatic load distribution** across volunteer relay nodes
- **No central server bottlenecks**

## Advantages Over Signal

### Technical Superiority
- **True P2P**: No AWS servers to compromise or shutdown
- **Higher Performance**: 50M msg/s vs Signal's server limitations  
- **Better Privacy**: No metadata visible to any central authority
- **Censorship Resistant**: Cannot be blocked by governments

### User Benefits  
- **No Phone Numbers**: Username-based system preserves anonymity
- **Offline Resilience**: Messages stored by relay nodes when recipients offline
- **Developer Friendly**: Open protocol enables third-party clients
- **Cost Effective**: No server infrastructure costs
