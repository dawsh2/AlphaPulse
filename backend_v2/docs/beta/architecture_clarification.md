## Architecture Clarification Summary

### Flash Loan Arbitrage is Self-Contained
- Executes WITHIN the strategy, not through execution engine
- Direct path: Market Data → Strategy → Blockchain
- Strategy detects opportunity AND executes atomically
- Only reports results for monitoring

### Simplified Development Roadmap
1. **Phase 1**: Flash loan arb (standalone, just needs market data)
2. **Phase 2**: Portfolio/Risk/Execution engines for risk-managed strategies

### Two Distinct Strategy Types
1. **Risk-Managed**: Use full stack (Portfolio → Risk → Execution)
2. **Self-Contained**: Independent operation, results reporting only

This eliminates unnecessary complexity and allows flash loan strategies to be developed and deployed independently.
