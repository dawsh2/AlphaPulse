//! # Execution State Management - Order Lifecycle and Fill Tracking (Planned)
//!
//! ## Purpose
//!
//! **Status: ðŸš§ PLACEHOLDER - Future Implementation Required**
//!
//! Planned comprehensive execution state management system for order lifecycle tracking,
//! fill aggregation, execution quality analytics, and order book reconstruction.
//! Will provide real-time monitoring of trading execution across centralized and
//! decentralized exchanges with complete audit trails and performance measurement.
//!
//! ## Integration Points (Planned)
//!
//! - **Input Sources**: Order events from ExecutionRelay, fill confirmations from exchanges
//! - **Output Destinations**: Portfolio managers, risk systems, analytics dashboard
//! - **Order Tracking**: Complete lifecycle from submission to settlement
//! - **Fill Management**: Real-time aggregation with slippage and timing analysis
//! - **Quality Metrics**: Execution cost analysis and venue performance comparison
//! - **State Persistence**: Audit trail persistence with regulatory compliance support
//!
//! ## Architecture Role (Planned)
//!
//! ```text
//! Order Submissions â†’ [Execution Tracking] â†’ [Fill Aggregation] â†’ [Quality Analytics]
//!        â†“                    â†“                     â†“                     â†“
//! Strategy Orders       Order State Machine   Fill Processing     Performance Metrics
//! Portfolio Updates     Lifecycle Tracking    Cost Analysis       Venue Comparison
//! Risk Adjustments      Status Monitoring     Slippage Tracking   Execution Quality
//! Manual Orders         Audit Trail           Settlement Confirm  Regulatory Reports
//! ```
//!
//! Execution state management will serve as the comprehensive tracking and analytics
//! layer for all trading activity across the AlphaPulse trading infrastructure.
//!
//! ## Performance Profile (Target)
//!
//! - **Order Processing**: <100Î¼s per order state update with full lifecycle tracking
//! - **Fill Aggregation**: <50Î¼s per fill processing with real-time cost calculation
//! - **State Queries**: <10Î¼s for order status lookup via optimized indexing
//! - **Analytics Generation**: <1ms for complete execution quality report generation
//! - **Memory Usage**: <64MB for tracking 10,000+ active orders with full history
//! - **Persistence**: <500Î¼s for audit trail write with zero hot-path blocking
//!
//! ## Planned Features
//!
//! ### Order Lifecycle Management
//! - **State Machine**: Track orders through complete lifecycle (pending â†’ open â†’ partial â†’ filled/cancelled)
//! - **Status Monitoring**: Real-time order status updates with detailed event logging
//! - **Cross-Exchange**: Unified order tracking across multiple venues and protocols
//! - **Error Recovery**: Order state reconciliation and failure handling
//!
//! ### Fill and Settlement Tracking
//! - **Fill Aggregation**: Aggregate partial fills per order with cost basis calculation
//! - **Settlement Monitoring**: Track on-chain settlement confirmation for DEX trades
//! - **Slippage Analysis**: Real-time slippage measurement versus expected execution
//! - **Cost Attribution**: Complete execution cost breakdown including gas and fees
//!
//! ### Execution Quality Analytics
//! - **Performance Metrics**: Execution speed, fill rate, and cost efficiency measurement
//! - **Venue Comparison**: Cross-exchange execution quality analysis and ranking
//! - **Strategy Attribution**: Execution performance breakdown by trading strategy
//! - **Regulatory Reporting**: Audit trail generation for compliance requirements
//!
//! ## Example Design (Future)
//!
//! ```ignore
//! pub struct ExecutionStateManager {
//!     orders: HashMap<OrderId, OrderState>,
//!     fills: Vec<Fill>,
//!     order_books: HashMap<InstrumentId, OrderBook>,
//! }
//!
//! impl Stateful for ExecutionStateManager {
//!     type Event = ExecutionEvent;
//!     type Error = ExecutionError;
//!     
//!     fn apply_event(&mut self, event: Self::Event) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {
//!         match event {
//!             ExecutionEvent::OrderNew(order) => self.add_order(order),
//!             ExecutionEvent::OrderFill(fill) => self.process_fill(fill),
//!             ExecutionEvent::OrderCancel(id) => self.cancel_order(id),
//!             // ...
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
