**🔴 CRITICAL TASK - AUDIT-009**: Architecture Gap Resolution
- **Status**: TODO (unstarted)
- **Priority**: CRITICAL  
- **Branch**: `fix/architecture-alignment`
- **Scope**: Network layer restructuring, strategy reorganization, adapter completion

### Sprint Status Summary from task-manager.sh:
```
🚨 CRITICAL PRIORITY TASKS:
- MYCEL-001: actor transport [IN_PROGRESS] 
- AUDIT-009: architecture gap resolution [TODO] - THIS REPORT'S FOCUS
- MVP-001: Shared Message Types Migration [TODO]
- TEST-003: e2e golden path [TODO]
```

## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE GAPS BEING ADDRESSED

### 1. Network Layer Restructuring (Phase 1 - 2 hours)
**Current Issue**: Transport layer scattered across `network/transport/` with improper module structure  
**Target**: Clean `network/src/transport.rs` with unified exports  
**Evidence**: Git shows `network/transport/` deletion, new `network/src/` creation

**Required Actions**:
- ✅ Create `network/Cargo.toml` at proper level (DONE - visible in new structure)
- ✅ Move transport components to `network/src/` (DONE - git status shows this)
- ⚠️ Update dependent crates to use new structure (NEEDS VALIDATION)

### 2. Strategy Layer Reorganization (Phase 2 - 2 hours)  
**Current Issue**: `flash_arbitrage` exists as both sub-crate AND module  
**Evidence**: Directory structure shows:
```
services_v2/strategies/
├── flash_arbitrage/          # Sub-crate (unwanted)
└── src/flash_arbitrage/      # Module (target)
```

**Required Actions**:
- Convert sub-crate to pure module structure
- Consolidate binaries under `services_v2/strategies/src/bin/`
- Update service references

### 3. Polygon Adapter Implementation (Phase 3 - 2 hours)
**Current Status**: ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETE  
**Evidence**: New polygon adapter structure exists:
```
services_v2/adapters/src/polygon/
├── collector.rs    ✅ Created
├── mod.rs         ✅ Created (with proper architecture)
├── parser.rs      ✅ Created
└── types.rs       ✅ Created
```

**Analysis**: Polygon adapter foundation is actually implemented correctly! This represents significant progress.

### 4. Test Infrastructure Enhancement (Phase 4 - 2 hours)
**Status**: ✅ FOUNDATION COMPLETE  
**Evidence**: `tests/e2e/tests/full_pipeline_test.rs` shows comprehensive pipeline testing:
- Mock exchange integration
- Collector → Relay → Consumer flow
- Performance validation (>1M msg/s target)
- Error handling and backpressure testing

## 🧪 NEW TEST INFRASTRUCTURE

### Performance Validation Tests
**Location**: `libs/types/tests/gap_performance_validation.rs`
**Purpose**: Ensure Protocol V2 performance targets maintained during refactoring
**Metrics**:
- Message construction: >500K msg/s (conservative test target)  
- Mixed TLV throughput validation
- Performance regression detection

**Key Insight**: Tests use conservative targets (500K msg/s) vs production targets (>1M msg/s) for reliable CI execution.

### End-to-End Pipeline Testing
**Location**: `tests/e2e/tests/full_pipeline_test.rs`
**Coverage**:
- Complete message flow validation
- Throughput measurement (>1000 msg/s test minimum)
- Error handling scenarios  
- Backpressure management

## 📊 COMPLETED SPRINTS ANALYSIS

### Sprint 014: MessageSink Architecture ✅ COMPLETE
**Achievement**: Lazy connection pattern implemented
**Impact**: Services decoupled from connection management
**Location**: `backend_v2/libs/message_sink/`

### Sprint 006: Protocol V2 Performance ✅ COMPLETE  
**Achievement**: >1M msg/s construction, >1.6M msg/s parsing maintained
**Impact**: Production-ready performance validated

## 🚧 IMMEDIATE BLOCKERS & ISSUES

### Blocker 1: Architecture Misalignment (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: AUDIT-009 architecture gaps block further development
**Impact**: Services may reference non-existent paths after transport restructuring  
**Solution**: Execute AUDIT-009 structured implementation plan

### Blocker 2: Service Integration Dependencies
**Issue**: Network restructuring may break dependent service compilation
**Validation Needed**: `cargo check --workspace` after network changes
**Mitigation**: Systematic import updates as defined in AUDIT-009

### Blocker 3: Performance Regression Risk
**Issue**: Major architectural changes could affect >1M msg/s targets
**Monitoring**: Performance validation tests implemented but need execution
**Requirement**: Benchmark before/after AUDIT-009 completion

## ✅ POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS

### 1. Test Infrastructure Maturation
- Comprehensive performance validation tests created
- Full pipeline E2E testing implemented  
- Conservative test targets ensure CI reliability

### 2. Polygon Adapter Foundation
- Clean adapter architecture implemented
- Proper module structure with collector, parser, types
- alphapulse_codec integration demonstrated

### 3. Network Layer Progress  
- Transport consolidation largely complete
- Clean module structure emerging
- Old fragmented structure successfully removed

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES

### Priority 1: Complete AUDIT-009 (CRITICAL - 8 hours)
**Why**: Unblocks all other architectural work  
**Branch**: `fix/architecture-alignment`  
**Phases**: Network (2h), Strategy (2h), Adapter (2h), Testing (2h)
**Validation**: Full workspace compilation and performance benchmarks

### Priority 2: Post-AUDIT Service Integration (HIGH - 4 hours)
**Dependencies**: AUDIT-009 completion
**Scope**: Update service imports for new network structure
